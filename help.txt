Wondering if I could get some help with some of my code using the Prolgue webserver?

My code is here: https://github.com/jsonbash/webserver/blob/main/src/routes.nim

I get an error when compiling that is in the Readme. I think it is in my doAnalysisOnText function when it references a variable outside of its
scope. I am not sure what to change, any help is appreciated!
